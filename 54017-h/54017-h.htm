<span class="i0">At oaths on their lips, the deriding<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And jestings that load every breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While on with dread swiftness are gliding<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No deep-tinted hues you might lend her<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Could touch the faint gold of her hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blue of her eyes, or the neatness<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of quaint little gown, smoothly spun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From threads of soft gray, whose completeness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doth fit her withdrawn gentle sweetness&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Over the road where danger lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On each bridge and curve of the midnight way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shooting across the rivers’ laps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up the mountains, into the gaps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through West Virginia like the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fire and sword coming on behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whistling defiance that echoed back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To mountain guerrillas burning the track,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A motley crowd&mdash;the city thief;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The man of God; the polished chief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a band of gamblers; the traitor spy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The correspondent with quick, sharp eye;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The speculator who boldly made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His fifty per cent. in a driving trade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the edge of the war; the clean lank clerk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sent West for sanitary work;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bounty-jumper; the lordling born<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Viewing the country with wondering scorn&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A strange assemblage filled the car<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That dared the midnight border-band,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where life and death went hand-in-hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those strange and breathless days of war.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Flashes back in the lantern’s beam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through shadows down at the rearward door?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The conductor pauses; all eyes explore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The darkened corner: a woman’s face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrown back asleep&mdash;the shimmer of lace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sheen of silk, the yellow of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flash of jewels, the careless fold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of an India shawl that half concealed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_009" id="page_009"></a>{9}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The curves superb which the light revealed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sweep of shoulder, a rounded arm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A perfect hand that lay soft and warm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the dingy seat; all the outlines rare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a Milo Venus slumbered there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Neath the costly silk whose heaviest fold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Subordinate seemed&mdash;unnoticed mould<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the form beneath.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">The sumptuous grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the careless pose, the sleeping face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Transfixed all eyes, and together drew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One and all for a nearer view:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lank clerk hasted, the gambler trod<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the heels of the gazing man of God;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The correspondent took out his book,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sharpened his pencil with eager look;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soldiers fought as to who should pass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first; the lord peered through his glass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But no sooner saw the sleeping face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than he too hasted and left his place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To join the crowd.<br /></span>
<span class="i15">Then, ere any spoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all eager gazed, the lady woke.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Lifted up in soft surprise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_010" id="page_010"></a>{10}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wealth of hair of auburn red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Falling in braids from the regal head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose little hat with waving plume<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay on the floor&mdash;while a faint perfume,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The roses, crushed in sleep, betrayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tangled within the loosened braid;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bold features, Nubian lips, a skin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Creamy pallid, the red within<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mixed with brown where the shadow lies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dark beneath the lustrous eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She smiles; all hearts are at her feet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She turns; each hastens to his seat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The car is changed to a sacred place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lighted by one fair woman’s face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sudden silence on they ride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lord and the gambler, side by side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The traitor spy, the priest as well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound for the time by a common spell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And each might be in thought and mien<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A loyal knight escorting his queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So instant and so measureless<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is the power of a perfect loveliness.<br /></span>

<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">The</span> Western city with the Roman name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vine-decked river winding round the hills,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Down from the northern lake whose cool breath fills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The whole horizon, like the green, salt sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is riding southward on the cautious train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That feels its way along, and nervously<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hurries around the curve and o’er the bridge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fearing a rebel ball from every ridge&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wild adventurous cavalry campaign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Morgan and his men, bold riders all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kept up in fair Kentucky all those years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So hot with daring deeds, with glowing tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That even Peace doth sometime seem a pall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When men in city offices feel yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old wild thrill of “Boots and saddles all!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dashing raid they cannot quite forget<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Despite the hasty graves that silent lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along its route; at home the women sigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gazing across the still untrodden ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across the fields, across the lonely moor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“O for the breathless ardor of those days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When we were all so happy, though so poor!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_012" id="page_012"></a>{12}</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Talking of all the splendors of the war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With faces grimed and roistering braggart tone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the gray dawning, sweet and fair to view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like opening wood-flower pearled with morning dew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She shines among them in her radiance pure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Notes all their lawless roughness, sadly sure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They’re very wicked&mdash;hoping that the day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of long-drawn hours may safely wear away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bring her, ere the summer sunset dies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the far farm-house where her lover lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wounded&mdash;alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i15">The rattling speed turns slow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slow, slower all the rusty car-wheels go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The axles groan, the brakes grind harshly down;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The young conductor comes&mdash;(there was a face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He noted in the night)&mdash;“Madam, your place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will soon be noisy, for at yonder town<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We take on other soldiers. If you change<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your seat and join that little lady, then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It will not seem so lonely or so strange<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For you, as here among so many men.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifting her fair face from the battered seat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where she had slumbered like a weary child,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_013" id="page_013"></a>{13}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lady, with obedience full sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To his young manhood’s eager craving, smiled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rose. Happy, the flushed youth led the way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She followed in her lovely disarray.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The clinging silk disclosed the archèd foot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hidden within the dainty satin boot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dead-black against the dead-white even hue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of silken stocking, gleaming into view<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One moment; then the lady sleepily<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adjusted with a touch her drapery,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tried to loop in place a falling braid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smooth the rippling waves the night had made;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the first sunbeams flashing through the pane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Set her bright gems to flashing back again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all men’s eyes in that Kentucky car<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grew on her face, as all men’s eyes had done<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the night-train that brought her from afar,<br /></span>

<p class="c"><i>From the Springfield Republican.</i></p>

<p>“Miss Constance Fenimore Woolson’s poem, ‘Two Women,’ begun in the
January and finished in the February number of <span class="smcap">Appletons’ Journal</span>, is of
such remarkable quality as to deserve a wider reading than it is likely
to have. To read it in completeness gives one, beyond its faults&mdash;which
are principally those of imperfect versification and a certain formality
of phraseology&mdash;a sense of power in character-drawing (coloring enough,
too, for that matter), in dramatic situation and in expression of deep
emotions, which is rarely met with. The contrast between the magnificent
woman of the world and the Puritan country-girl is done in true masterly
way, and that the one should continue faithful to love through her life,
though still reigning in social royalty, while the other marries as
piously as she mourned, and puts away the dead youth’s memory
forever&mdash;is perfectly true to their natures. To present such marked
types in rivalry, and show the self-abnegation in the rich nature and
the innocent self-absorption of the narrow nature, was well worth while.
The poem would make quite a little book, and better merits such
treatment than most verses that receive it.”</p>

<p class="c"><i>From the New York Evening Post.</i></p>

<p>“In the poem ‘Two Women,’ the first half of which appeared in the
January number of <span class="smcap">Appletons’ Journal</span>, and the last half of which has
just now come to us in the February number of that magazine, there is
something, we think, which takes the piece out of the category of
ordinary magazine-work, and entitles it to special attention. The poem
is long enough, for one thing, to fill a little volume, if it were
printed as it is the custom to print books of poetry, and while it is
rugged, faulty, and in many respects defective, it is nevertheless
strong, dramatic, and full of the flavor of the soil. The two women who
gave it its name are types of two well-defined classes of American
women, but they are sharply drawn as individuals also, and their
characters are presented with a boldness and a degree of distinctness
which is possible only at the hands of a writer of very considerable
dramatic power.”</p>

<p class="c"><i>From the Providence Journal.</i></p>

<p>“A story in verse, which enchains the attention with fascinating power,
... produces an intensely emotional effect upon the reader, and at the
same time an involuntary tribute to the originality and noteworthy
ability of the writer.”</p>

<p class="c"><i>From the Detroit Post.</i></p>

<p>“One of the most powerful pieces of magazine-writing we have seen in a
long time.... Shows a far-reaching knowledge of human nature, a dramatic
grasp and force, and a power of description and expression seldom seen.”</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
